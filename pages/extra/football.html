            <h2><strong>Football</strong></h2>
<p>As with hurling, Waterford has a long tradition of Association Football, and Mount Sion has a proud history in this regard also. Indeed, the school could currently lay claim to be the leading school in Waterford, given our fantastic successes in Munster at the highest level in both U-17 and U-19 age groups this year. A fantastic recent addition has been our state of the art all-weather pitch.There have been numerous other successes over the years ( including a 1998 Munster title featuring future Irish senior international Noel Hunt ). Current Waterford FC stalwart and League of Ireland legend Kenny Browne is also a past pupil, while Paddy Barrett and Justin Croke among many others have also enjoyed representative success whilst attending Mount Sion CBS. Given the current crop of talent, this list will surely grow in the future.</p>
