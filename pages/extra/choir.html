            <h2><strong>Mount Sion Choir</strong></h2>
<p>Mount Sion choir runs at lunchtime every day. It is part of the Foroige network and encourages pupils who are not sporty to be involved in a school club. The choir includes pupils from 1st year up to 6th year. Many of the musicians are self taught and they are encouraged to explore areas of music that interest them. We generally perform modern songs, picked by the pupils themselves. There are approximately 25 members in the choir; most performances are local ones such as singing for school services and performing in local talent shows. There are three teachers involved with the choir Ms.Kearney, Ms.Keane and Ms.Sheridan. For the past two years, we have competed in the Young Bohemian International Choral Festival in Prague. This year, the choir were awarded Silver in their category. Mount Sion were the heart and soul of the competition and were wonderful ambassadors for our school and city.</p>
