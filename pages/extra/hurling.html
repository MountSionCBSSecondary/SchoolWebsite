            <h2><strong>Hurling</strong></h2>
<p>Mount Sion has a long and proud tradition of participation in our national sports, fielding successful teams in hurling and football for generations. Hurling has been to the forefront, the school proudly winning Waterford&rsquo;s first Harty Cup in 1953. Many of the stars of that team formed the backbone of the famed Waterford county team of that era. Hurling is alive and well in the present era with many future county players (from club and county legend Ken McGrath to current panellist Ian O&rsquo;Regan) passing through the school. The school has won numerous County and Munster titles and just this year (2018) made a welcome return to the Munster PPS Roll of Honour, with a thrilling one point victory over Tralee CBS.
