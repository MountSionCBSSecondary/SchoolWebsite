           <h2><strong>Basketball</strong></h2>
<p>Basketball enjoyed huge national popularity in the late nineties and was played in the school during this era. Indeed, past pupil Eamonn Sheehan captained Waterford Crystal to their one and only Superleague title in the 2001/02 season. After a lapse of a number of years, basketball was re-introduced to Mount Sion in 2013. As is typical of the school, we saw a need for something extra for a growing and changing school population, and responded to it. We now provide competitive basketball for 1st and 2nd years, and at U-16 and U-19 levels. Brand new facilities mean basketball is here to stay and it is only a matter of time before significant success follows. That said, in our first year we were victorious in the South East regional league, gaining promotion to our current league. We have been very competitive at this level, making a number of finals, and look forward confidently to further progress.</p>
