<p><u><strong>School Internet Acceptable Usage Policy.</strong></u></p>
<p><u><strong>November 2018.</strong></u></p>
<p><br /> <u><strong>Rationale.</strong></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aim of this acceptable usage policy (AUP) is to ensure that students get maximum benefit from the learning opportunities offered by the school&rsquo;s ICT and internet resources in a safe and responsible manner. The school has two fully equipped computer rooms, one portable class set of twenty four chromebooks, all classrooms have a teacher&rsquo;s computer with wired internet access and all classrooms and common areas have WIFI access.The school&rsquo;s wifi system provides two networks, an open public network and a password protected private network. Internet use and access is considered a school resource and privilege. If the school&rsquo;s AUP is not adhered to, this privilege will be withdrawn and appropriate sanctions will be imposed.</p>
