<h3><strong>Mount Sion C.B.S &ndash; Relationship &amp; Sexuality Education Policy</strong></h3>
<p>Mount Sion is a Catholic boys school, founded by Blessed Edmund Rice in 1802. Its students are educated with Catholic values as laid down in the teaching of the Church. The school fosters the development of relationships based on the love of God and the love of every human being.</p>
<p>R.S.E. enshrines the principles of our Mission Statement in being a lifelong process of acquiring knowledge and understanding and of developing attitudes, beliefs and values concerning sexual identity, relationships and intimacy. R.S.E. is an integral part of a total programme of Social, Personal and Health Education (S.P.H.E.). It is important that R.S.E. is taught in the context of S.P.H.E. and the religious education as set out in the &ldquo;Christian Way&rdquo; series. To enable us to manage and organise the implementation of R.S.E. in our school it will be included on the timetable as part of S.P.H.E.</p>
<p>Students will deal with issues such as instruction on puberty, physical change, sexual intercourse, conception and birth. We respectively encourage parents to take responsibility for educating their children in these areas. Our staff will endeavour to be sensitive to family situations.</p>
<p>Teachers participating in the Programme will be qualified to do so and will be committed to its successful implementation.</p>
<p>The extent to which the content of the programme will be treated will be dependent on the intellectual and emotional maturity of the students. Taking this into account we will build upon and develop the Primary School Programme.</p>
<p>In teaching the R.S.E. programme, it will be stressed that moral truth is not arrived at by consensus, or the product of feelings, or instinct, or by saying that what is right for one person may be wrong for another. Moral judgement is a matter of reason.</p>
<p>The school will ensure that there is ongoing support, development and review for all involved in the R.S.E. programme.</p>
<p>Any parent who may have concerns about the programme or any aspects therein is invited to meet with the school authorities to discuss these concerns.</p>
<p>If you choose to provide R.S.E. at home, your rights as a parent with regard to your son&rsquo;s participation in the school&rsquo;s R.S.E. programme will be respected.</p>
<p>The programme content for R.S.E. adheres to the guidelines as set down by the National Council for Curriculum Assessment.</p>
