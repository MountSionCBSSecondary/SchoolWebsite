<b>Management and Organisation of SPHE in Mount Sion</b>
<p>
The school is presently committed to offering all classes one period of SPHE per week at Junior Cycle Level. Within that time Relationships and Sexuality Education is taught as a module of 6-8 lessons.
</p>
<p>
At senior level, SPHE is incorporated into the Religious Education content and it is aimed to provide classes yearly on Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE).
</p>
<p>
Through RSE, the school aims to provide opportunities for students to learn about relationships and sexuality in ways that help them to think and act in a moral, caring and responsible way.
</p>








<b>The RSE Programme aims to:</b>
<ul>
	<li>Help young people to understand and develop friendships and relationships</li>

	<li>Promote an understanding of sexuality</li>

	<li>Promote a positive attitude to one’s own sexuality and relationships with others</li>

	<li>Promote knowledge of and respect for human reproduction</li>

	<li>Enable young people to develop attitudes and values towards their sexuality in a moral, spiritual and social framework</li>
</ul>
</br>
<b>RSE Programme Content</b>
<p>
Teachers will use materials deemed suitable and appropriate for students needs and in accordance with the school ethos.
</p>
<p>
The content of the RSE Programme is described under three themes. These themes are neither sequential nor discrete; they manage and overlap with each other.
</p>
<p>
1.	Human Growth and Development
</p>
<p>
This theme consists of an age appropriate understanding of the biology and psychology of the human life cycle. This is accompanied by a rationale for responsible behaviour in relationships and sexual activity.
</p>
<p>
2.	Human Sexuality
</p>
<p>
Sexuality is an integral part of the human personality and has biological, psychological, cultural, social and spiritual dimensions. The theme offers opportunities to develop a holistic understanding of sexuality as contributing to the development of personal well being, enhancing personal and family relationships and ultimately contributing to the well being of society.
</p>
<p>
3.	Human Relationships
</p>
<p>
This theme focuses on the importance of relationships for health and well-being. It examines how one relates to self and others, stressing the importance of self-esteem as a basis for worthwhile friendships and relationships. It addresses issues such as communication, influence, intimacy, sexual attraction and sexual expression in relationships consistent with personal and moral integrity.
</p>
