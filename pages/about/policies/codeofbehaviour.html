<p><em><strong>Code of Behaviour</strong></em></p>
<p>In the school situation a large number of people work together. Therefore, it is essential to have a high standard of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>COURTESY</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>CO-OPERATION</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>RESPECT</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Negative comments about a person&rsquo;s creed, race or sexual orientation will not be tolerated and could lead to disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Any type of behaviour which endangers students themselves or others cannot be permitted, e.g. cycling within the school grounds, use of gally-banders, laser pens, Halloween bangers, etc.</p>
<p>Smoking in the school or in and near the school grounds is strictly forbidden. As a place of work it should be noted that all schools must be smoke free.</p>
<p>Students must attend Physical Education classes unless excused for medical reasons. They must have the appropriate sports gear.</p>
<p>Mount Sion is keen to promote civic mindedness in our students and an awareness of the importance of a litter free environment. Pupils found littering will be required to redress situation and clean up littered area. Litter warden may be informed of littering in the vicinity of the school.</p>
<p>To avoid unnecessary disruption and disturbance to the school, students may not use <strong>Mobile Phones</strong> in the school during school hours. Failure to respect this rule will result in the confiscation of <strong>Mobile Phones (inc. SIM Card)</strong> for a period of <strong>24 hours for first offence, 48 hours for a second and 72 for a third. </strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Positive Behaviour Management</strong></em></p>
<p>We believe that some of our pupils may need help in relation to developing good behaviour. Intervening early and frequently avoids minor issues developing into more difficult disciplinary problems.</p>
<p>Expected good behaviour is explained, taught and consistently applied throughout the school environment; this type of approach is called &lsquo;Positive Behaviour Management&rsquo;</p>
<p>(PBM).</p>
<p>If a pupil is struggling in relation to behaviour which may lead to more serious discipline issues he attends a PBM class from 15.30 to 16.00 each day (Wed 13.00 to 13.30); this 30 minute period is a compulsory part of the school day for those pupils. Normal classes end at 15.30 (Wed 13:00) for those not attending PBM.</p>
<p>We put time and resources into helping pupils conduct themselves properly.</p>
<p><strong>The extra time spent in PBM is very beneficial:</strong></p>
<p>Pupils are taught proper and respectful behaviour</p>
<p>Problems will not fester and become major issues</p>
<p>Issues are dealt with immediately</p>
<p>Parents are made aware of issues arising on a daily basis</p>
<p>Suspensions are avoided if pupils co-operate</p>
<p>You, as Parents/Guardians, can help by becoming familiar with what we expect from your son and we ask that you continually encourage him to aim for and maintain the highest standards.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disciplinary Sanctions</strong></em></p>
<p>Pupil offence such as foul language, persistent talking, no PE gear, disruption unsatisfactory homework, etc.</p>
<p>Subject teacher may reprimand pupil, assign extra work, give worksheet, detain pupil, leave pupil standing for reasonable period, etc</p>
<p>Subject teacher informs parent(s) with note in school journal or standard letter.</p>
<p>Further offence where subject teacher considers reprimand necessary.</p>
<p>Subject teacher informs parent(s) by phone of ongoing misbehaviour. Subject teacher notes details of incident(s) and parental contact in discipline book.</p>
<p>Further offence by pupil.</p>
<p>Subject teacher meets parent(s) and notes details and outcome in discipline book.</p>
<p>Further offence by pupil.</p>
<p>Principal/Deputy Principal consults parent(s) and outlines problems.</p>
<p>Further offence by pupil.</p>
<p>Principal may sanction suspension up to 3 days if deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>Further offence by pupil.</p>
<p>Principal may sanction suspension for 3 days if deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>Further offence by pupil.</p>
<p>Principal may sanction suspension for 1 week if deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>Parents may have to attend Board of Management meeting to discuss son&rsquo;s persistent misbehaviour.</p>
<p>Further offence by pupil.</p>
<p>Further offence by pupil.</p>
<p>Further suspension or proposal for expulsion as deemed appropriate by Board of Management</p>
<p>Authority to suspend a pupil delegated to the Principal by the Board of Management at a properly convened Board meeting.</p>
<p><em><strong>Suspension From School</strong></em></p>
<p>The school uses suspensions for serious misbehaviour such as serious disruption of class, dangerous or offensive behaviour in or around the school, verbal/physical abuse of staff or other pupils, vandalism and theft.</p>
<p>The initial period of suspension is for <strong>three days</strong>. However should the student fail to show an improvement a <strong>one week</strong> suspension may be sanctioned. At this stage parents should be more than aware of the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>As every eventuality cannot be covered by specific mention in the Code of Behaviour the school authorities will interpret and decide in specific situations.</p>
<p>At any given stage or where a student&rsquo;s suspension totals twenty or more days in a school year, an appeal may be made to the Department of Education &amp; Science.</p>
<p><em><strong>Exclusion From School</strong></em></p>
<p>The process of sanctions of increasing seriousness outlined is designed to avoid exclusion of pupils, as far as possible, and to keep the suspension of pupils from school to a minimum. However, this will be achieved only if pupils and parents take the initial steps in the process seriously and thus avoid progressing to more serious sanctions.</p>
<p>Where the above have been undertaken by a pupil with no consequent change for the better in behaviour the pupil and parents may be invited to attend a Board meeting where the pupil&rsquo;s future in the school will be considered.</p>
<p>Exclusion of a pupil from school is reserved for the school Board of Management. It is applied as a last resort and, in normal circumstances, only after the process described has been completed. When the matter of the exclusion of a pupil arises, the Principal makes a full report to the Board on the pupil&rsquo;s behaviour and also invites the parents to make any submission they wish to the Board.</p>
<p>The Board may exclude a pupil without using the procedure outlined in cases where the pupil&rsquo;s behaviour cannot be tolerated, even for a short time, for example, severe violence towards pupils or staff or grossly insulting behaviour. In such cases the pupil is suspended until the next meeting of the Board, which then decides on the matter as described.</p>
