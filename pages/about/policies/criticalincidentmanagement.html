<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p><i>Mount Sion CBS </em>aims to protect the well-being of its students and staff by providing a safe and nurturing environment at all times. The following outlines the school&rsquo;s Critical Incident Management Plan.</i></p>
<h4><strong>Review and Research</strong></h4>
<p>The Critical Incident Management Team have consulted resource documents available to schools on www.education.ie and www.nosp.ie including:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Responding to Critical Incidents Guidelines and Resources for Schools (NEPS 2016)</li>
   <li>Suicide Prevention in Schools: Best Practice Guidelines (IAS, National Suicide Review Group (2002)</li>
   <li>Suicide Prevention in the Community - A Practical Guide (HSE 2011)</li>
   <li>Well-Being in Post-Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (DES, DOH, HSE 2013)</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h4><strong>Definition of a critical incident</strong></h4>
<p>The staff and management of Mount Sion CBS recognise a critical incident to be &ldquo;an incident or sequence of events that overwhelms the normal coping mechanism of the school&rdquo;. Critical incidents may involve one or more students or staff members, or members of our local community. Types of incidents might include:</p>
<ul>
   <li>The death of a member of the school community through accident, violence, suicide or suspected suicide or other unexpected death</li>
   <li>An intrusion into the school</li>
   <li>An accident involving members of the school community</li>
   <li>An accident/tragedy in the wider community</li>
   <li>Serious damage to the school building through fire, flood, vandalism, etc</li>
   <li>The disappearance of a member of the school community</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h3><strong>Aim </strong></h3>
<p>The aim of the Critical Incident Management Plan is to help school management and staff to react quickly and effectively in the event of an incident, to enable us to maintain a sense of control and to ensure that appropriate support is offered to students and staff. The plan aims to ensure that the effects on the students and staff will be limited and a return to normality will be in place as soon as possible.</p>
<h4><strong>Creation of a coping supportive and caring ethos in the school</strong></h4>
<p>We have put systems in place to help to build resilience in both staff and students, thus preparing them to cope with a range of life events. These include measures to address both the physical and psychological safety of the school community.</p>
<h4><strong>Physical safety</strong></h4>
<ul>
   <li>Evacuation plan formulated</li>
   <li>Fire drills occur</li>
   <li>Fire exits and extinguishers are regularly checked</li>
   <li>Supervision rota for break periods</li>
   <li>Automatic door locks during school hours</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Psychological safety</strong></h4>
<p>The management and staff of <em>Mount Sion CBS </em>aim to use available programmes and resources to address the personal and social development of students, to enhance a sense of safety and security in the school and to provide opportunities for reflection and discussion.</p>
<ul>
   <li>Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE) is integrated into the work of the school. It is addressed in the curriculum by addressing issues such as grief and loss; communication skills; stress and anger management; resilience; conflict management; problem solving; help-seeking; bullying; decision making and prevention of alcohol and drug misuse. Promotion of mental health is an integral part of this provision</li>
   <li>Staff have access to training for their role in SPHE</li>
   <li>Staff are familiar with the Child Protection Guidelines and Procedures and details of how to proceed with suspicions or disclosures</li>
   <li>Books and resources on difficulties affecting the primary/post primary school student are available</li>
   <li>Information is provided on mental health in general and such specific areas as signs and symptoms of depression and anxiety</li>
   <li>Staff are informed in the area of suicide awareness and some are trained in interventions for suicidal students</li>
   <li>The school has developed links with a range of external agencies &ndash; Squashy Couch, SCP</li>
   <li>Inputs to students by external providers are carefully considered in the light of criteria about student safety, the appropriateness of the content, and the expertise of the providers</li>
   <li>The school has a clear policy on bullying and deals with bullying in accordance with this policy</li>
   <li>There is a Student Support Team in place</li>
   <li>Students who are identified as being at risk are referred to the designated staff member (e.g. guidance counsellor or support teacher), concerns are explored and the appropriate level of assistance and support is provided. Parents are informed, and where appropriate, a referral is made to an appropriate agency</li>
   <li>There is a mentoring programme available every morning as a support for students</li>
   <li>Staff are informed about how to access support for themselves</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3><strong>Confidentiality and good name considerations</strong></h3>
<p>Management and staff of Mount Sion CBS have a responsibility to protect the privacy and good name of people involved in any incident and will be sensitive to the consequences of public statements. Members of school staff will bear this in mind, and seek to ensure that students do so also, e.g. the term &lsquo;suicide&rsquo; will not be used unless there is solid information that death was due to suicide, <em>and </em>that the family involved consents to its use. The phrases &lsquo;tragic death&rsquo; or &lsquo;sudden death&rsquo; may be used instead. Similarly, the word &lsquo;murder&rsquo; should not be used until it is legally established that a murder was committed. The term &lsquo;violent death&rsquo; may be used instead.</p>
