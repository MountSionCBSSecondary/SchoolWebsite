<h3><em><strong>Welcome to Mount Sion</strong></em></h3>
<h3><em><strong>The World&rsquo;s Oldest Edmund Rice School</strong></em></h3>
<p>Mount Sion was founded by Edmund Rice in 1802. It was the first school founded by the Christian Brothers. The school has a proud tradition of educational service in Waterford and the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>This tradition has been carefully maintained while striving always to keep up with the ever changing trends and developments in the field of education.</p>
<p>Central to the school&rsquo;s educational policy has always been the personal welfare of the student and the development of his talents, attributes and skills. It is the intended effect of this policy that a student develops personal responsibility, social awareness, emotional maturity, love of learning and an appreciation of his own unique worth.</p>
<p>Mount Sion strives to ensure that your son&rsquo;s time spent in our school will be rewarding in every way.</p>
<p>The creation of such a learning environment is assisted in Mount Sion by a highly skilled and dedicated teaching staff and by those who provide the ancillary services which are vital to a modern and progressive school.</p>
<p>We look forward to the contribution that Mount Sion can make to your son&rsquo;s future and also look forward to your son&rsquo;s contribution to the enrichment of school life in Mount Sion.</p>

<h4><em><strong>LEAVING CERTIFICATE VOCATIONAL PROGRAMME.</strong></em></h4>
<p>The Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (L.C.V.P.) was introduced as a Leaving Certificate with a strong vocational dimension. It provides students with the opportunity to release their potential for self directed learning, for innovation and for enterprise. In Mount Sion this programme is available to boys only.</p>
<p>The L.C.V.P. gives students every opportunity for access to third-level education. The country&rsquo;s universities have announced that points will be awarded for the Link Modules.</p>
<p>Students take two Link Modules or short courses as part of the L.C.V.P. These are Enterprise Education, and Preparation for The World of Work. Each module is important in preparing students for life after school.</p>
<p>The Link Modules are activity based. These activities include the organisation and running of mini- enterprises, visits to business and industry.</p>
<p>Th Link Modules are assessed by the National Council for Vocational Awards (N.C.V.A.).</p>
<p>Junior Achievement and working with Business Volunteers &ndash; the Goals of the Programme are</p>
<ul>
   <li>Supplement subjects like History &amp; Geography with business and economics related skills and concepts</li>
   <li>Increase the student&rsquo;s awareness of business generally</li>
   <li>Show the students a variety of career opportunities</li>
   <li>Help the students understand the complexities of producing, marketing and selling a product</li>
   <li>Make the students aware of the importance of education for future career development</li>
</ul>
<h4><em><strong>Learning Support</strong></em></h4>
<p>Mount Sion C.B.S. provides a learning support service for those students in need of extra help. The purpose and aim of this service is to help and encourage students attain their full potential for academic achievement primarily in the areas of literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p>The basic skills in these two areas of learning are essential prerequisites to enhance a student&rsquo;s ability, not just directly in English and Mathematics but also indirectly in all the additional subject areas of the curriculum.</p>
<p>In this school the programme of learning support is very much structured to this theme of a cross-curricular purpose. It is hoped that students who require extra tuition in the areas of literacy and numeracy will be able to transfer the skills acquired here to benefit their learning acumen across the range of curriculum subjects.</p>
<h4><em><strong>RELIGIOUS EDUCATION</strong></em></h4>
<p><strong>Religious Education</strong> is an integral part of the Curriculum in Mount Sion. It aims to promote the development of the individual in the light of the Gospel.</p>
<p>The aims of the Religious Education Programme are;-</p>
<ul>
   <li>To facilitate and support the ongoing development of the faith and spiritual life of the student</li>
   <li>To provide the students with a deeper knowledge and understanding of their faith and then to apply this knowledge and understanding to their lives</li>
   <li>To help the students to be aware that they are the stewards of creation and that humanity will constantly depend on their standards and sense of values</li>
   <li>To develop in the students the skills of listening, discussion, evaluation and communication in the area of religion</li>
   <li>To explore Christian revelation in the context of their concrete situation with a view to invoking a response based in faith</li>
   <li>To seek to help the students not only to know about God but to know God</li>
   <li>To promote understanding of other faiths and respect for the belief of others</li>
</ul>
<p>The Religion department fully realises that it can only effectively do this in partnership with the home.</p>
<h4><em><strong>SUPPORT CARE TEAM</strong></em></h4>
<p>Care and concern for our students and for their general wellbeing have always been a priority with the staff here at Mount Sion. Young people today face many pressures during their teens. Any kind of stress can impinge on their performance at school and in exams. It would be the hope of the staff here that students would be aware that within the school, there will always be someone there to help them or, simply, to listen to them. Parents can play an important part in the pastoral area of the school by informing us of any worries or problems affecting the students.</p>
<p>While Pastoral Care is the concern of all the school community we do have a formalised Support Care Team.</p>
<p>The committee consists of</p>
<p>Principal Mr. J. McArdle</p>
<p>Deputy Principal Mr. B. Doherty</p>
<p>HSCL Mr. F. Farrelly</p>
<p>Resource Teacher Ms. C. Kearney</p>
<p>SCP Co-ordinator Mr. A. Battell</p>
<p>If parents think we may be of assistance in any way we would suggest that they contact us through the school.</p>
<h4><em><strong>HOME SCHOOL COMMUNITY LIAISON</strong></em></h4>
