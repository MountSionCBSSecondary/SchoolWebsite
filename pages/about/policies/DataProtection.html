<p><strong>Introductory Statement</strong></p>
<p>The school&rsquo;s Data Protection Policy applies to the personal data held by the school which is protected by the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.</p>
<p>The policy applies to all school staff, the board of management, parents/guardians, students and others (including prospective or potential students and their parents/guardians and applicants for staff positions within the school) insofar as the measures under the policy relate to them. Data will be stored securely, so that confidential information is protected in compliance with relevant legislation. This policy sets out the manner in which personal data and sensitive personal data will be protected by the school.</p>
<p><strong>Data Protection Principles</strong></p>
<p>The school is a <em>data controller</em> of <em>personal data </em>relating to its past, present and future staff, students, parents/guardians and other members of the school community. As such, the school is obliged to comply with the principles of data protection set out in the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 which can be summarised as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Obtain and process </strong><strong><em>Personal Data</em></strong><strong> fairly</strong>:Information on students is gathered with the help of parents/guardians and staff. Information is also transferred from their previous schools. In relation to information the school holds on other individuals (members of staff, individuals applying for positions within the School, parents/guardians of students etc.), the information is generally furnished by the individuals themselves with full and informed consent and compiled during the course of their employment or contact with the School. All such data is treated in accordance with the Data Protection Acts and the terms of this Data Protection Policy. The information will be obtained and processed fairly.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it only for one or more specified and explicit lawful purposes</strong>: The School will inform individuals of the reasons they collect their data and will inform individuals of the uses to which their data will be put. All information is kept with the best interest of the individual in mind at all times.</li>
<li><strong>Process it only in ways compatible with the purposes for which it was given initially</strong>: Data relating to individuals will only be processed in a manner consistent with the purposes for which it was gathered. Information will only be disclosed on a need to know basis, and access to it will be strictly controlled.</li>
<li><strong>Keep </strong><strong><em>Personal Data</em></strong><strong> safe and secure</strong>:Only those with a genuine reason for doing so may gain access to the information. Sensitive Personal Data is securely stored under lock and key in the case of manual records and protected with firewall software and password protection in the case of electronically stored data. Portable devices storing personal data (such as laptops) should be encrypted and password protected before they are removed from the school premises. Confidential information will be stored securely and in relevant circumstances, it will be placed in a separate file which can easily be removed if access to general records is granted to anyone not entitled to see the confidential data.</li>
<li><strong>Keep Personal Data accurate, complete and up-to-date</strong>: Students, parents/guardians, and/or staff should inform the school of any change which the school should make to their personal data and/or sensitive personal data to ensure that the individual&rsquo;s data is accurate, complete and up-to-date. Once informed, the school will make all necessary changes to the relevant records. The principal may delegate such updates/amendments to another member of staff. However, records must not be altered or destroyed without proper authorisation. If alteration/correction is required, then a note of the fact of such authorisation and the alteration(s) to be made to any original record/documentation should be dated and signed by the person making that change.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure that it is adequate, relevant and not excessive</strong>:Only the necessary amount of information required to provide an adequate service will be gathered and stored.</li>
<li><strong>Retain it no longer than is necessary for the specified purpose or purposes for which it was given</strong>: As a general rule, the information will be kept for the duration of the individual&rsquo;s time in the school. Thereafter, the school will comply with DES guidelines on the storage of Personal Data and Sensitive Personal Data relating to a student. In the case of members of staff, the school will comply with both DES guidelines and the requirements of the Revenue Commissioners with regard to the retention of records relating to employees. The school may also retain the data relating to an individual for a longer length of time for the purposes of complying with relevant provisions of law and or/defending a claim under employment legislation and/or contract and/or civil law.</li>
<li><strong>Provide a copy of their </strong><strong><em>personal data</em></strong><strong> to any individual, on request</strong>: Individuals have a right to know what personal data/sensitive personal data is held about them, by whom, and the purpose for which it is held.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the Policy:</strong> The Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 apply to the keeping and processing of <em>Personal Data</em>, both in manual and electronic form. The purpose of this policy is to assist the school to meet its statutory obligations, to explain those obligations to School staff, and to inform staff, students and their parents/guardians how their data will be treated.</p>
<p>The policy applies to all school staff, the board of management, parents/guardians, students and others (including prospective or potential students and their parents/guardians, and applicants for staff positions within the school) insofar as the school handles or processes their <em>Personal Data </em>in the course of their dealings with the school.</p>
<p><strong>Definition of Data Protection Terms</strong></p>
<p>In order to properly understand the school&rsquo;s obligations, there are some key terms which should be understood by all relevant school staff:</p>
<p><strong><em>Data</em></strong> means information in a form that can be processed. It includes both <em>automated data</em> (e.g. electronic data) and <em>manual data</em>. <em>Automated data </em>means any information on computer, or information recorded with the intention that it be <em>processed</em> by computer. <em>Manual data</em> means information that is kept/recorded as part of a <em>relevant filing system</em> or with the intention that it forms part of a relevant filingsystem.</p>
<p><strong><em>Relevant filing system</em></strong> means any set of information that, while not computerised, is structured by reference to individuals or by reference to criteria relating to individuals, so that specific information relating to a particular individual is readily, quickly and easily accessible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Personal Data</em></strong> means data relating to a living individual who is or can be identified either from the data or from the data in conjunction with other information that is in, or is likely to come into, the possession of the Data Controlleri.e. theschool.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sensitive Personal Data</em></strong> refers to <em>Personal Data </em>regarding a person&rsquo;s</p>
<ul>
<li>Racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or religious or philosophical beliefs</li>
<li>Membership of a trade union</li>
<li>Physical or mental health or condition or sexual life</li>
<li>Commission or alleged commission of any offence or</li>
<li>Any proceedings for an offence committed or alleged to have been committed by the person, the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings, criminal convictions or the alleged commission of an offence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Data Controller</em></strong> for the purpose of this policy is the board of management, Mount Sion CBS Secondary School.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p>In addition to its legal obligations under the broad remit of educational legislation, the school has a legal responsibility to comply with the Data Protection Acts, 1988 and 2003.</p>
<p>This policy explains what sort of data is collected, why it is collected, for how long it will be stored and with whom it will be shared. As more and more data is generated electronically and as technological advances enable the easy distribution and retention of this data, the challenge of meeting the school&rsquo;s legal responsibilities has increased.</p>
<p>The school takes its responsibilities under data protection law very seriously and wishes to put in place safe practices to safeguard individual&rsquo;s personal data. It is also recognised that recording factual information accurately and storing it safely facilitates an evaluation of the information, enabling the principal and board of management to make decisions in respect of the efficient running of the School. The efficient handling of data is also essential to ensure that there is consistency and continuity where there are changes of personnel within the school and board of management.</p>
<p><strong>Other Legal Obligations</strong></p>
<p>Implementation of this policy takes into account the school&rsquo;s other legal obligations and responsibilities. Some of these are directly relevant to data protection. <strong><em>For example:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Under Section 9(g) of the <a href="http://acts2.oireachtas.ie/zza51y1998.1.html">Education Act, 1998</a>, the parents of a student, or a student who has reached the age of 18 years, must be given access to records kept by the school relating to the progress of the student in their education</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Under Section 20 of the <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2000/a2200.pdf">Education (Welfare) Act, 2000</a>, the school must maintain a register of all students attending the School</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Under section 20(5) of the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, a Principal is obliged to notify certain information relating to the child&rsquo;s attendance in school and other matters relating to the child&rsquo;s educational progress to the principal of another school to which a student is transferring</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Under Section 21 of the <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2000/a2200.pdf">Education (Welfare) Act, 2000</a>, the school must record the attendance or non-attendance of students registered at the school on each school day</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Under Section 28 of the <a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2000/a2200.pdf">Education (Welfare) Act, 2000</a>, the School may supply <em>Personal Data </em>kept by it to certain prescribed bodies (the Department of Education and Skills, the National Education Welfare Board, the National Council for Special Education, other schools, other centres of education) provided the School is satisfied that it will be used for a &ldquo;relevant purpose&rdquo; (which includes recording a person&rsquo;s educational or training history or monitoring their educational or training progress in order to ascertain how best they may be assisted in availing of educational or training opportunities or in developing their educational potential; or for carrying out research into examinations, participation in education and the general effectiveness of education or training)</li>
<li>Under Section 14 of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, 2004, the school is required to furnish to the National Council for Special Education (and its employees, which would include Special Educational Needs Organisers (&ldquo;SENOs&rdquo;)) such information as the Council may from time to time reasonably request</li>
<li>The Freedom of Information Act 1997 provides a qualified right to access to information held by public bodies which does not necessarily have to be &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; as with data protection legislation. While schools are not currently subject to freedom of information legislation, if a school has furnished information to a body covered by the Freedom of Information Act (such as the Department of Education and Skills, etc.) these records could be disclosed if a request is made to that body</li>
<li>Under Section 26(4) of the Health Act, 1947 a School shall cause all reasonable facilities (including facilities for obtaining names and addresses of pupils attending the school) to be given to a health authority who has served a notice on it of medical inspection, e.g. a dental inspection</li>
<li>Under <em>Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children</em> (2011) published by the Department of Children &amp; Youth Affairs, schools, their boards of management and their staff have responsibilities to report child abuse or neglect to TUSLA - Child and Family Agency (or in the event of an emergency and the unavailability
of TUSLA, to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na). </li>
</ul>
<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><strong>October Returns </strong></p>
<p>(a)<strong>Categories</strong>: At the beginning of each academic year (and for 1st year or transferring students, on enrolment) parents/guardians and students are asked to provide the school with certain information so that the School can make returns to the Department of Education and Skills (&ldquo;DES&rdquo;) referred to as &ldquo;October Returns&rdquo;. These October Returns will include sensitive personal data regarding personal circumstances which are provided by parents/guardians and students on the basis of explicit and informed consent. The October Return contains individualised data (such as an individual student&rsquo;s PPS number) which acts as an &ldquo;identifier&rdquo; for the DES to validate the data that belongs to a recognised student. The DES also transfers some of this data to other government departments and other State bodies to comply with legislation, such as transfers to the Department of Social Protection pursuant to the Social Welfare Acts, transfers to the State Examinations Commission, transfers to the Educational Research Centre, and transfers to the Central Statistics Office pursuant to the Statistics Acts. The data will also be used by the DES for statistical, policy-making and research purposes. However the DES advises that it does not use individual data, but rather aggregated data is grouped together for these purposes. The DES has a data protection policy which can be viewed on its website (<a href="https://www.education.ie/en/">www.education.ie</a>). The DES has also published a &ldquo;Fair Processing Notice&rdquo; to explain how the personal data of students and contained in October Returns is processed. This can also be found on <a href="https://www.education.ie/en/">www.education.ie</a> (search for Circular Letter 0047/2010 in the &ldquo;Circulars&rdquo; section).</p>
<p>(b)<strong>Purposes:</strong> The school asks parents/guardians and students to complete October Returns for the purposes of complying with DES requirements to determine staffing and resource allocations and to facilitate the orderly running of the school. The main purpose of the October Returns is for the DES to determine whether the student qualifies for English language support and/or additional resources and support to meet their particular educational needs. The October Returns are submitted to the DES electronically. The DES has their own policy governing the security of the data sent to them by all post-primary schools. The co-operation of each student and/or their parents/guardians in completing the October Return is greatly appreciated as the school&rsquo;s aim is to ensure that each student is assisted in every way to ensure that s/he meets his/her full potential.</p>
<p>(c)<strong>Location</strong>: In a secure, locked filing cabinet that only personnel who are authorised to use the data can access. Employees are required to maintain the confidentiality of any data to which they have access.</p>
<p>(d)<strong>Security</strong>: Records are kept in manual record form (personal file within a relevant filing system) and/or computer record (database). Depending on actual use, manual records are kept in filing cabinets in Principal&rsquo;s office or Secretarial office. At end of day these offices are locked and security alarmed. Archived records are kept in filing cabinets in locked office photocopy room or stored in strong-room. Computer records are safeguarded with password and up to date security software. At end of the day the computer laptops are stored overnight in the secure strong-room.</p>

<p><strong>Processing in line with data subject&rsquo;s rights</strong></p>
<p>Data in this school will be processed in line with the data subjects' rights.</p>
<p>Data subjects have a right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to any data held about them by a data controller</li>
<li>Prevent the processing of their data for direct-marketing purposes</li>
<li>Ask to have inaccurate data amended</li>
<li>Prevent processing that is likely to cause damage or distress to themselves or anyone else.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dealing with a data access requests</strong></p>
<p>Section 3 access request</p>
<p>Under Section 3 of the Data Protection Acts, an individual has the right to be informed whether the school holds data/information about them and to be given a description of the data together with details of the purposes for which their data is being kept. The individual must make this request in writing and the data controller will accede to the request within 21 days.</p>
<p>The right under Section 3 must be distinguished from the much broader right contained in Section 4, where individuals are entitled to a copy of their data.</p>
<p>Section 4 access request</p>
<ul>
<li>Individuals are entitled to a copy of their personal data on written request.</li>
<li>The individual is entitled to a copy of their personal data (subject to some exemptions and prohibitions set down in Section 5 of the Data Protection Act)</li>
<li>Request must be responded to within 40 days</li>
<li>Fee may apply but cannot exceed &euro;6.35</li>
<li>Where a subsequent or similar request is made soon after a request has just been dealt with, it is at the discretion of the school as data controller to comply with the second request (no time limit but reasonable interval from the date of compliance with the last access request.) This will be determined on a case-by-case basis.</li>
<li>No personal data can be supplied relating to another individual unless that third party has consented to the disclosure of their data to the applicant. Data will be carefully redacted to omit references to any other individual and only where it has not been possible to redact the data to ensure that the third party is not identifiable would the school refuse to furnish the data to the applicant.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Providing information over the phone</strong></p>
<p>In our school, any employee dealing with telephone enquiries should be careful about disclosing any personal information held by the school over the phone. In particular the employee should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the identity of the caller to ensure that information is only given to a person who is entitled to that information</li>
<li>Suggest that the caller put their request in writing if the employee is not sure about the identity of the caller and in circumstances where the identity of the caller cannot be verified</li>
<li>Refer the request to the principal for assistance in difficult situations. No employee should feel forced into disclosing personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implementation arrangements, roles and responsibilities </strong></p>
<p>In our school the board of management is the data controller and the principal will be assigned the role of co-ordinating implementation of this Data Protection Policy and for ensuring that staff who handle or have access to <em>Personal Data</em> are familiar with their data protection responsibilities</p>
<p>The following personnel have responsibility for implementing the Data Protection Policy:</p>
<p><strong>Name</strong><strong>Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>Board of management:Data Controller</p>
<p>Principal:Implementation of Policy</p>
<p>Teaching personnel:Awareness of responsibilities</p>
<p>Administrative personnel:Security, confidentiality</p>
<p>IT personnel:Security, encryption, confidentiality</p>
<p><strong>Ratification &amp; communication</strong></p>
<p>When the Data Protection Policy has been ratified by the board of management, it becomes the school's agreed Data Protection Policy. It should then be dated and circulated within the school community. The entire staff must be familiar with theData Protection Policy and ready to put it into practice in accordance with the specified implementation arrangements. It is important that all concerned are made aware of any changes implied in recording information on students, staff and others in the school community. Parents/guardians and students should be informed of the Data Protection Policy from the time of enrolment of the student e.g. by including the Data Protection Policy as part of the Enrolment Pack, by either enclosing it or incorporating it as an appendix to the enrolment form.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring the implementation of the policy </strong></p>
<p>The implementation of the policy shall be monitored by the principal and a sub-committee of the board of management. At least one annual report should be issued to the board of management to confirm that the actions/measures set down under the policy are being implemented.</p>
<p><strong>Reviewing and evaluating the policy </strong></p>
<p>The policy should be reviewed and evaluated at certain pre-determined times and as necessary. On-going review and evaluation should take cognisance of changing information or guidelines (e.g. from the Data Protection Commissioner, Department of Education and Skills or the NEWB), legislation and feedback from parents/guardians, students, school staff and others.&nbsp;The policy should be revised as necessary in the light of such review and evaluation and within the framework of school planning.</p>
