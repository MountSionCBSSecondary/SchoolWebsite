<p><strong>Identification of Pupils with SEN</strong></p>
<p>We recognise that many pupils will present with special educational needs at some stage during their time in school. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to identify those pupils as early as possible. Pupils with psychological assessments are given priority SEN provision in the school but we also aim to help other pupils who face academic or behavioural difficulties during their time in school.</p>
<p>The following are the main ways we use to identify pupils with SEN</p>
<ul>
<li>Communication with local Primary School teachers, principals, parents, NEPS psychologists and the SENO</li>
<li>Analysis of information supplied on Post-Primary Transfer Form</li>
<li>STEN Score Analysis</li>
<li>Entrance assessment results</li>
<li>Screening and Diagnostic Tests which pupils sit in September of entrance year</li>
<li>Teachers reporting difficulties that may arise in class</li>
<li>Reports from external agencies which identify difficulties pupils may be experiencing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Relevant personnel involved in the education of pupils with SEN</strong></p>
<p>The specific roles of each educational partner can be found in the Post Primary Guidelines for the Inclusion of Students with Special Educational Needs. These partners have been given information regarding their roles and responsibilities. The following are brief overviews of the roles of each partner:</p>
<ul>
<li>Board of Management: To facilitate the inclusion of pupils with SEN through inclusive enrolment policies and by promoting inclusive whole-school policies and procedures</li>
<li>The Principal: The principal is responsible for the day to day management of all aspects of the school including the SEN provision. He/she must ensure that the special educational needs of the pupils are addressed and encourage all teachers to include these pupils in classwork and maximise their learning</li>
<li>Mainstream Teachers: The teacher is responsible for all pupils in their classroom, including pupils with SEN. They must ensure that pupils with SEN are included in as many aspects of learning as possible. Teachers may need to differentiate the curriculum to make their subject more accessible to pupils with SEN</li>
<li>SEN Co-ordinator: The SEN Co-ordinator manages the day to day running of the SEN team within school. Communication with students, parents, teachers, outside agencies and management plays a significant part in the role of SEN Co-ordinator</li>
<li>Special Needs Assistants: SNAs act in a caring and supportive role for pupils with SEN. They provide support to designated pupils, but they may also give support to other pupils whom management feel may need extra help</li>
<li>Parents: The school encourages parental involvement, regularly contacts parents and welcomes any queries and advice that parents can offer about their child. Parents are given regular updates on their son&rsquo;s progress in school. There is an open door policy with regard to parents and this is particularly evident in our SEN Department. The Home School Community Liaison teacher acts as a valuable link between the SEN team and the parents</li>
<li>Learning Support/Resource Teacher: Mount Sion CBS aims to reduce the number of Resource classes and instead use more Learning Support strategies such as team teaching, stations teaching and peer teaching. Individual/small group withdrawal will only be used when learning support is deemed unsuitable. We believe learning support can be inclusive of all pupils with SEN and make pupils more independent in and out of school. Resource teaching may be necessary for a small number of pupils with low incidence SEN</li>
<li>Pupils: Pupils&rsquo; strengths and needs are at the heart of the school&rsquo;s SEN policy. We encourage our pupils to become independent learners, set realistic targets and maximise their potential. We do not want our pupils with SEN to become &lsquo;dependent&rsquo; on Learning Support/Resource classes. Pupils are encouraged to talk and we will listen to their suggestions and thereby try to implement new learning strategies that will improve their school experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SEN Provision in Mount Sion CBS Secondary School</strong></p>
<p>The school SEN provision uses a variety of measures to implement our policy</p>
<ul>
<li>Varied teaching and learning strategies to ensure pupils with SEN can access the curriculum.</li>
<li>Flexibility in teaching pupils, particularly those with special needs</li>
<li>SEN Co-ordinator informs teachers of new teaching strategies through delivery at staff meetings or via email.</li>
<li>SEN department includes one qualified teacher who holds the Diploma for Special Needs Education and three other teachers with particular skills and interest in the area of SEN teaching</li>
<li>Implementation of Individual Educational Plans (IEPs) for all pupils with low incidence teaching hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Details of particular learning and teaching strategies can be found in the Mount Sion CBS Provision Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Policy regarding Bright and Gifted Pupils</strong></p>
<p>The school aims to identify bright and gifted pupils and promotes their educational development through</p>

<ul>
<li>National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS)</li>
<li>National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS)</li>
<li>National Council for Special Education (NCSE)</li>
<li>Health Service Executive (HSE)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Monitoring, Review and Evaluation of Policy</strong></p>
<p>The Principal is responsible for ensuring that the SEN policy is implemented in the school. This policy will be reviewed on a yearly basis by the Board of Management. The review will consider the views and experiences of pupils, parents, relevant staff and external agencies. Assessment and monitoring of the Policy will be carried out on a regular basis by the SEN team.</p>
