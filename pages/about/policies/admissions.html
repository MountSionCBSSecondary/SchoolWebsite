</ul>
<p>The school will admit each year the number of boys determined by the Board of Management.</p>
<p><em><strong>For the school year 2018/2019, this number will be 48 students.</strong></em></p>
<p>In deciding on the number of boys to be admitted, the Board will have due regard for the relevant Department of Education and Skills provisions in relation to class size, staffing allocation and/or any other relevant requirements concerning accommodation, such as physical space or the health and welfare of children. The final date for receipt of completed Enrolment Application Forms for the academic year 2018/2019 is 06/10/2017.</p>
<p>Where the number of applicants is greater than the number of available places, the Board of Management will apply the following selection criteriain the following order of importance in relation to applications received no later than 15.30 on 06/10/2017.</p>
<p>1.1 Boys who have present brothers in the school</p>
<p>1.2 Sons of current full time and part time teaching and non teaching staff with a</p>
<p>3 year minimum period of service.</p>
<p>1.3 Applicants from Mount Sion Primary School</p>
<p>1.4 All other applicants</p>
<p>If at any stage of this process, the number of applicants in the category to whom priority is been given exceeds the number of places remaining places will be offered on the basis of when applications were received, dated and recorded by the School Office. Time and date are recorded on acceptance of all applications. Proximity of home to school as determined by straight line measurement made by the school on the school&rsquo;s street map will be used as a deciding factor where applications were received on the same date and at the same time.Students not offered places in this process will have their names placed on a `Waiting List`, on the basis of when their applications were received by the School Office.</p>
<p>While recognising applicants&rsquo; rights to admission we consider that we have an overriding responsibility to our present school community, and in particular students already enrolled, to an education without disruption. The school therefore reserves the right to refuse enrolment to any applicant in exceptional cases. Such an exceptional case could arise where either:</p>
<p>1. The student has special needs such that, even with additional resources available from the Department of Education and Skills, the school cannot meet such needs and / or provide the student with an appropriate education; or</p>
<p>2. In the opinion of the Board of Management, the student poses an unacceptable risk to other students, to school staff or to school property.</p>
<p>New entrants to the school will only be accepted into First Year subject to the regulations outlined above. The policy in respect of students wishing to transfer from other schools is outlined in the relevant section of this policy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enrolment Procedure</em></strong></p>
<p>Parents will be presented with a copy of the School&rsquo;s Admission Policy with the Enrolment Application Form. The parents/guardians must return the Enrolment Application Form for entry to First Year by the date specified on the Application Form, 06/10/2017. Subsequent to 06/10/2017, the Principal will write to the 48 successful applicants and issue First Round Enrolment offers.</p>

Education (Welfare) Act 2000. Section 19(1).</p>
<p>The Board of Management advises parents/guardians that, in the event of a boy being refused entry to Mount Sion, an appeal may be made in writing to the Board of Management within 14 days of the decision being conveyed to the parents/guardians. An appeal may also be taken under Section 29 (d) of the Education Act, 1998. The parents/guardians will be informed in writing of the Board&rsquo;s decision and the reasons why the student was not accepted. The right to appeal under Section 29 (d) of the Education Act, 1998 will be restated and the Application Form provided (Circular M48/01).</p>

As a general rule, appeals will only be considered by an appeals committee under Section 29 where the parties are unable to resolve the issue at local level. (Circular M48/01)</p>
