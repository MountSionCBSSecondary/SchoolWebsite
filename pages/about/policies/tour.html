<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Mount Sion CBS Secondary School has a duty of care to all its pupils and to school personnel. We seek to safeguard the welfare of pupils while on foreign school tours and also to support school personnel who accompany pupils.</p>
<p>The Tour Leader must ensure that:</p>
<p>1. Every reasonable step will be taken to ensure the safety of all tour members. Pupils must not be placed in situations which expose them to an unacceptable level of risk. Pupils should have EHIC cards well before departure.</p>
<p>2. There is appropriate and adequate supervision for each activity undertaken on the tour.</p>
<p>3. Once the tour details have been approved, ask for a non-returnable deposit. Make it clear that the deposit is non-returnable and that pupils will not be taken if their behaviour is unacceptable or unsafe in the interval before the tour takes place.</p>
<p>4. The ratio of adults to pupils will be appropriate; a ratio of not more than 10:1, and if a higher ratio is proposed then this must be authorised by the Principal. If the Tour</p>
<p>Leader brings a group without an Assistant, he/she must have back&ndash;up support available.</p>
<p>5. Child protection procedures are in place in line with the DES guidelines and the relevant child protection procedures put in place by Mount Sion CBS School. Please refer to Prudence Code attached in <strong>Appendix 4.</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Parental consent forms set out in </strong><em><strong>Appendix 1</strong></em><strong> have been issued and returned signed: the onus is on parents to return all completed documentation and failure to do so may mean that a student may not be permitted to travel.</strong></p>
<p>7. Suitable arrangements have been made for the medical needs of all pupils.</p>
<p>8. He/she is in possession of the following information:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Details of medical conditions</li>
   <li>The student&rsquo;s GP&rsquo;s name, address and telephone number</li>
   <li>Written details of any medication required (including instructions on dosage/times) and parental permission to administer same</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>(Appendix 2 Medical Consent Form)</strong></h4>
<p>9. First aid provision is available. The medical kit should always include a thermometer and the medical histories of all participants, the information being acquired from the Parents/Guardians.</p>
<p>10. Parents/Guardians are sent the following information:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Dates and times of departure and return &ndash; parents/guardians must have agreed to</li>
</ul>
<p>meet their student on return</p>
<ul>
   <li>Details of accommodation such as hotel address and telephone number</li>
   <li>Names of Tour Leader, of other staff and of other accompanying adults</li>
   <li>Standards of behaviour expected in respect of, for example, alcohol, smoking and</li>
</ul>
<p>general group discipline</p>
<ul>
   <li>Details of insurance taken out for the group as a whole, and whether</li>
</ul>
<p>parents/guardians need to arrange additional cover</p>
<ul>
   <li>Details on the cost of the visit including methods and deadlines for payments. All payments are to be considered non- refundable including the final payment</li>
</ul>
<p>11. A school emergency contact person has been nominated and the Tour Leader has these details. The Tour Leader should also ensure that the school Contact Person and all those accompanying the trip have a copy of the agreed emergency procedures, the names of all members of the group and emergency contact details of all Parents/Guardians.</p>
<p>The Principal must ensure that all staff and others accompanying the tour are appropriately selected and accept that the Tour Leader is in charge. It would also be expected that all have appropriate experience of supervising pupils of the relevant age on the tour.</p>
<h4><strong>Information retained at the school</strong></h4>
<p>Full details of the visit should be retained at the school while the tour is in progress. This should include:</p>
<ul>
   <li>the itinerary and contact phone number/address for the group</li>
   <li>a list of group members and their details</li>
   <li>contact names, addresses and phone numbers of the parents/guardians</li>
   <li>a copy of the contract with the tour company/hotel etc</li>
</ul>
<p>It is the Principal&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure that this information is available at all times, particularly if the tour takes place when the school is closed.</p>
<h4><strong>Prohibition</strong></h4>
<p>The consumption of alcohol by all pupils is forbidden for all tours.</p>
<p>Up to the time of departure it shall remain the prerogative of the Tour Leader to refuse a pupil&rsquo;s participation on the tour without a refund should the pupil&rsquo;s behaviour give cause for grave concern.</p>
<p>Parents/Guardians and pupils must agree to <strong>Rules and Regulations (Appendix 3)</strong> and return signed copies to the Tour Leader.</p>
<p><strong>Review </strong>This policy will be reviewed on an annual basis.</p>
<h4><strong>This policy has been adopted by the Board</strong></h4>

<p><strong>Appendix 3</strong></p>
<p>Dear Parent/Guardian,</p>
<p>The itinerary is now available, and it is advisable that your son reads it carefully, in order to familiarise himself with the programme of events for each day in ________.</p>
<p>The success of the tour depends on the full cooperation of all pupils with their tour leaders. We are confident that the boys whom we have trusted enough to take abroad, will behave responsibly and will respect the authority of the seven teachers, who are giving their free time and their good will to make this tour possible. Unfortunately, however, we are aware that the bad behaviour of one can spoil things for everybody else. Hopefully, this won&rsquo;t happen. For our part, we will do our best to make this trip an enjoyable and successful experience for all who are travelling to ______________.</p>
<p>I would like, now, to draw your attention to a few simple, but absolutely vital points which we feel are essential to the success of the tour. After reading them, I would be grateful if you and your son, would please sign the agreement form printed below.</p>
<h4><u><strong>Rules and Regulations</strong></u></h4>
<ul>
   <li>Pupils are expected to BE PUNCTUAL at all times, especially for meals and for bus pickup times<strong>. </strong>As many items on the itinerary are pre-booked for a specific time, lateness and delays might, unfortunately, mean missing out on some events.</li>
   <li>Pupils are expected to KEEP THEIR ROOMS CLEAN AND TIDY,and to show respect and courtesy to hotel staff, at all times.</li>
   <li>The hotel may also be used by other holiday groups, so don&rsquo;t be surprised if you have to queue for service occasionally.</li>
   <li>BE PATIENTAnd please don&rsquo;t complain too much if the food doesn&rsquo;t suit you! European meals are different to our own, but they are good and healthy.</li>
   <li>A coach will be at our disposal for the duration of the tour. It is important that everyone shows respect and courtesy to the driver and keeps the bus as litter free as possible.</li>
   <li>SMOKING IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN, especially on the bus and in the hotel.</li>
   <li>The boys will be given some free time each day, for shopping and for sightseeing. On these occasions, they will not be under the direct supervision of their teachers. However, it is vital that nobody strays too far, or becomes lost. Stay reasonably close to the meeting point for the bus pickup, and DO NOT WANDER OFF ON YOUR OWN.</li>
   <li>DO NOT USE THE METRO(underground train). It is a complicated system to understand, especially in a foreign language, and many Metro stations are considered quite dangerous, particularly at night.</li>
   <li>The purchase and/or consumption of ALCOHOLIC DRINK/DRUGS IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN on the tour<u><strong>.</strong></u> Anybody caught in possession of alcohol/drugs will be reported to his parents and to the school authorities. He may also lose some of his free time privileges on the tour, as we would be unable to trust him outside our supervision. He may also face a lengthy school suspension on his return to school.</li>
   <li>We feel it is important to reserve the right to search pupils baggage and belongings, if we have reasonable cause to suspect them of having any illegal materials/substances in their possession.</li>
</ul>
